    <h3><i> 'We are and always will be a nation of immigrants'-Barack Obama</i></h3>
    <p>We have created a website called Horizon Immigration that addresses the issue of immigration reform. This is a serious issue because there is no longer a place for immigrants. The United States is known to many immigrants as the land of opportunity and that is no longer the case. Some of the challenges immigrants face are language barriers, housing, employment opportunities, and education. These barriers are seen for immigrants in the United States and their native countries. This project aims to highlight that immigrants are looking for a place that embraces people from across the world who seek family reunification, education or housing, and humanitarian protection. Many immigrants do not know the resources available to them and we have created this website to provide those resources for them and their families helping any immigrant in need.</p>
