        <h4><i>“Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history.”</i></h4>
        <p>DACA (Deffered Action for Childhood Arrivals) in an administrative relief that protects eligible immigrants who came to the United States when they were children from deportation. DACA has helped hundreds of thousands of young people finish school, apply for a work permit, and be protected from detention and deportation. This program was announced by Barack Obama back in November 2014 and has had 835,097 approved applications by the USCIS.  
          Not surprisingly, DACA has increased high school attendance and graduation rates for unauthorized immigrant youth. because of their better jobs and higher incomes, DACA holders contribute more to the U.S. economy. DACA holders contribute nearly $42 billion to U.S. gross domestic product each year and add $3.4 billion to the federal balance sheet. Unfortunately DACA has phased many hardships during the years with politicians wanting to eliminate 
          this relief for Dreamers. Hopefully one day Dreamers will be on the path to citizenship in their own home.</p>
