                <h2 >Language</h2>
                <h4>The main language that is used in the 
                    United States education system is English. Given that Spanish is the most commonly spoken 
                    language among immigrants aged five and older, many immigrant students struggle in 
                    excelling in their education because they face a language barrier, according to Pew Research Center.
                    Immigrant children who do not speak English, or
                    are not as advanced in the English language as 
                    their peers, face difficulties with the learning process.
                    These students end up taking additional classes to strengthen their 
                    basic English skills. For many of them, education becomes stressful and catching up, impossible.

                <h2 >Social</h2>
                <h4>Social and cultural isolation is defined as “being cut off from normal social networks, such as 
                    having no access to normal services or community involvement, little or no communication with friends 
                    or family,” according to a research study conducted by No Isolation. Immigrant students often feel like 
                    they are different from their classmates and peers due to their diverse background, 
                    so they often have a difficult time making connections with others.

            <h2>Financial</h2>
            <h4>Immigrant families struggle financially due to unemployment, underemployment, 
                low wages and lack of assistance from the government. According to Live Stories Immigration and 
                Citizenship, 14.7% of immigrants in the United States live below federal poverty level. 
                When immigrant families are living in poverty, 
                it is difficult for families to support their children.

            <h2 >Racism</h2>
            <h4>There is actually more evidence to show that schools in the U.S. are negatively impacting
                 immigrant students and their families, not the other way around.
                Many immigrant students face discrimination and racism in the form of segregation and 
                hostile attitudes at their schools. Also, many schools don't offer essential resources, like 
                family liaisons or other social services, that would support 
                immigrant families as well as the larger school community.
